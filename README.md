# Personal Website
This will be our company website to showcase to customers

# Getting started
  - clone this repository into a local folder
  - run "npm install, npm audit fix" in the CompanyWebsite folder
  - run "sudo npm install live-server --save"
  - run "npm install jquery"
  - run "npm install node-sass"
  - then run npm run start in the command line (in the client folder inside of the project) to start the hotserver
  
## Side Notes:
  - the hot server is still a little whack so if you don't see changes on the webpage after you've made some change happen in the code, then restart the hot server. It is much faster than daves.
