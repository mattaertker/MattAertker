# Personal Website
This is my personal website that is currently undergoing, and is used for me to display all of my personal projects, school projects, accomplishments, and what services I offer most expertise in as a web developer!

# Getting started
  - You must have git, vs code, and node.js installed (npm -v to get version of npm)
  - clone respository on the master branch via HTTP clone repository option given by vs code
  - open new terminal in vs code
  - cd in "docs" directory
  - run npm install
  - run npm start, then your default broser should open a development window which you may have to reload for it to work
# TIPS:
    - for faster reloading, go into webpack.config.js and switch the environment variable from production to development
    - if you don't see changes on the webpage after you've made some change happen in the code, then restart the hot server (npm run start)
